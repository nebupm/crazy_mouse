# crazy_mouse
This is a simple python program that will keep your mouse on the move. But it will be within the confines of your screen.
This is usually relevant if you have a very brief screen saver and you dont want to be locked out every now and then.


## Pre requisites
Make sure you have python3 setup
You will need `pyautogui` module

```sh
pip install pyautogui
```
